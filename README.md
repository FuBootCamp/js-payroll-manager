# EMPLOYEE PAYROLL TRACKER 

## Description

```md
Programming in JavaScript is new to me.
I learned to program a long time ago and I thought it wouldn't be that hard to learn a new language, but things have changed, and the way JavaScript works is very different.
By developing this project I'm learning how HTML and CSS work with JavaScript, but mostly I'm discovering its potential.

I developed this project to:
    - Practice and consolidate my knowledge in JavaScript.
    - Understand how JavaScript can store data temporarily and manipulate it to generate information.
    - Deepen in the concept of arrays, objects and arrays of objects.
    - Understand how functions are declared and how they are called in the different parts of the program.

The challenge consists of temporarily storing the data of "n" employees so that through the startup code a matrix of employees is displayed on the web page, and through the manipulation of the data, the information required to be presented on the console can be generated.

During this project I learned:
    - How to define and manipulate an array of objects.
    - How to return a value from a function.
    - How to use the WHILE statement for a loop.
    - How to generate a random number in a given range.
    - How to display messsage in the console.
